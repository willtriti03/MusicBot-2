MusicBot is a Discord music bot written for [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") 3.10+, using the [py-cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) voice stack. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services into a Discord server (or multiple servers). If the queue is empty, MusicBot will play a list of existing songs that is configurable. The bot features a permission system, allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. MusicBot is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental).

## Setup
Setting up the MusicBot is relatively painless - just follow one of the [guides](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/). After that, configure the bot to ensure its connection to Discord.

The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`. If it does not exist yet, copy [`config/1_options.ini`](./config/1_options.ini) to `config/options.ini`. For reproducible installs, use `requirements.lock`.

### Commands

There are many commands that can be used with the bot. Most notably, the `play <url>` command (preceded by your command prefix), which will download, process, and play a song from YouTube or a similar site. A full list of commands is available [here](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/using/commands/ "Commands").
